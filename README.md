# Better Gator
Mental health concerns are on the rise and affect a wide range of individuals, especially college students. However, the stigma around mental health makes it difficult for students to reach out for support. The purpose of Better Gator is to create a safe space for the University of Florida students to deal with stress and to express and manage their day to day feelings in an accesible and free way.

## Project Description
Our iOS app provides students with several functionalities including:
 - Mood Tracker
 - Meditation Timer
 - GenAI Journal Prompts
 - Calender to access previous data

The technologies we used include:
- Swift UI
- XCode
- Gemini for GenAI
- Canva for Graphic Design

  ## Using the App
  Better Gator is an iOS app and must be run on an Apple Iphone. To test the code present in the repository one can use the Xcode simulator.

  ## App Walkthrough
  1. Click on the app icon.
  2. Upon entering the app, the user will see the home/welcome screen and will be greeted with a personalized message based on the time of day. Here the user has access to several functionalities. For the purpose of this demo let's start with the profile page. When the user clicks on the profile logo and the corresponding page will open. Here the user can enter their name and it will be saved to the app to display a greeting.
  3. Next, returning to the home screen, the user can look at the graphics below the "How are you feeling?" text. The user is prompted to select one of the images which is then highlighted.
  4. Scrolling further down, the user will encounter the quotes section. Here, the user is prompted to click the button and it will generate a motivational quote each time it is clicked.
  5. On the bottom of the page, the user can select an icon. The first one will take the user to the journal feature.
  6. Prompts are displayed based on mood already selected (or default of calm) and upon completion, short GenAI responses to the journal are given using Google Gemini. Later the responses and timestamps are stored into the device storage.
  7. On the home page, the user can select the meditation icon. They will be taken to a page where they can take part in a timed breathing practice.
  8. The last icon the user can select is the calendar icon.
 
## Learning
As a team, we collectively learned a lot from the project. Especially with technologies like Swift UI and XCode for app development, Gemini GenAI and API keys for generative AI and Canva for graphic design.

## Outlook
In the future, we plan on improving and adding new functionality to our app. A few of these features include, creating a journal history so users can look back at previous days and the ability to view emotion trends across a certain timespan.
